				<h2>The Best Time To Study</h2>
				<p>Science says that our cycles of alertness and focus are governed by Circadian rhythms. They are what forms our 24-hour sleep/wake cycle that then drives when we are hungry, when we are tired and even when we undertake activities such as work and study.</p>
				<p>But that is just the beginning of the story. There are a wide variety of lifestyle factors that influence when the best study time is for each individual person..</p>
				<p>It’s not hard to argue that studying during the day is a good choice. After all, we are refreshed in the morning after a good night’s sleep and should have just had an energy-filled breakfast that will sustain us well in to the day.</p>
				<p>During the day you are less likely to require indoor lighting. Sunlight is actually good for your eyes. It provides just the right spectrum of light to maintain optimal eyesight and actually works with the pituitary gland to make you alert and awake.</p>
				<p>Indoor lighting has been shown to interrupt the sleep cycle and most sleep doctors recommend that you expose yourself to as little artificial light at night as possible at night, including TV, computer and smartphone screens.</p>
				<p>The world as we know it tends to operate during “business hours.” This includes libraries, shops and Officeworks. Studying during daylight hours means that you can access businesses and libraries that are open 9am to 5pm, and get those odds and ends that may not be as available in the evenings.</p>
