    <strong>Social Sciences</strong>
	<article>
	<p>Social science is, in its broadest sense, the study of society and the manner in which people behave and influence the world around us.</p>
	<p>Social science tells us about the world beyond our immediate experience, and can help explain how our own society works - from the causes of unemployment or what helps economic growth, to how and why people vote, or what makes people happy. It provides vital information for governments and policymakers, local authorities, non-governmental organisations and others.</p>
	<p>A group of academic disciplines that examine society and how people interact and develop as a culture. Social science as a field of study is separate from the natural sciences, which cover topics such as physics and chemistry. Economics, political science, history, law and geography can be considered social sciences. </p>
	<p>Social science as an academic field of study developed out of the Age of Enlightenment as individuals began to take a more disciplined approach to quantifying their observations of society. Over time, similar aspects of a society, such as communication, were separated into unique fields of study. Statistical surveys and research methodologies helped prove or disprove theories. </p>
