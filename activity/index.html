				<h2>For Beginners</h2>
				<p>To begin with, this study guide site provides general information for four different kinds of examination: admission, licensing, vocational, and primary/secondary. Admission exams are those like the SAT or GRE that are taken as part of your application to college or graduate school. Licensing exams, for example the NCLEX and Praxis exams, are required for certification in professions like teaching and nursing. Vocational exams are part of the admissions process for professional schools and the military. A couple of the more popular vocational exams are the ASVAB and the HOBET examinations. Finally, primary and secondary school exams are those like the FCAT and the THEA that are taken by students in elementary, middle, and high school. Success on secondary exams can be essential to advancing to the next grade or receiving a high school diploma.</p>
